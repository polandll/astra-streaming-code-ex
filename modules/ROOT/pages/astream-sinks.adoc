= Astra Streaming sinks

Currently, two sinks are available for Astra Streaming:

* xref:astream-quick-start.adoc#create-a-sink[elasticsearch]
* xref:astream-quick-start.adoc#create-a-sink[cassandra-enhanced]

The ElasticSearch sink pulls messages from Pulsar topics and persists the
messages to indexes.
The Cassandra-enhanced sink pulls messages from Pulsar topics and inserts the data
in the Astra enhanced Cassandra database.
